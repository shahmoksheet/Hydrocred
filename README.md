Blockchain-Based Green Hydrogen Credit
System
Description:
In the transition to low-carbon economies, it's vital to accurately account for and incentivize
the production of truly “green” hydrogen—hydrogen generated from
renewable resources. This problem asks participants to design a system utilizing blockchain
technology to issue, track, and certify credits for every unit of certified green hydrogen
produced. Transactions, transfers, and retirements of credits between producers, certifying
authorities, and industrial consumers must be transparent and immutable. The system
should also support integration with external auditors or government verifiers and allow
for monitoring (and preventing) double counting or fraud.
User:
Green hydrogen producers, regulatory authorities, industry buyers (steel, ammonia,
transport companies), certification bodies.
Impact:
● Increases trust in claims of renewable hydrogen usage, boosting market
confidence.
● Enables industries to prove compliance with green mandates and meet
carbon-neutral goals.
● Encourages more producers to invest in certified green hydrogen due to clear
value and traceability.
